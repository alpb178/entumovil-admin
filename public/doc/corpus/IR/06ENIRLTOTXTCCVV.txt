solicitor as trustee for the Purchaser.
21. (a)	If by reason of any default on the part of the Purchaser, the Sale shall not have been completed on or
before the later of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) such subsequent date whereafter delay in completing shall
not be attributable to default on the part of the Vendor
		

(i)	the Purchaser shall pay interest to the Vendor on the balance of the Purchase Price remaining
unpaid at the Stipulated Interest Rate for the period between the Closing Date (or as the case may be
such subsequent date as aforesaid) and the Completion Date. Such interest shall accrue from day to
day and shall be payable before and after any judgment

		 and
		

(ii)	the Vendor shall in addition to being entitled to receive such interest, have the right to take the rents
and profits less the outgoings of the Subject Property up to the Completion Date.

(b)	If the Vendor by reason of his default shall not be able, ready and willing to complete the Sale on the
Closing Date he shall thereafter give to the Purchaser at least five Working Days’ prior notice of a date
upon which he shall be so able ready and willing and the Purchaser shall not before the expiration of that
notice be deemed to be in default for the purposes of this Condition provided that no such notice shall be
required if the Vendor is prevented from being able and ready to complete or to give said notice by reason
of the act or default of the Purchaser.

Vendor shall not for the purposes of this Condition be deemed to be in default during the period of notice
given pursuant to clause (b) of this Condition. Such compensation shall accrue from day to day and shall
be payable before and after any judgment.
(d)	Neither the Vendor nor the Purchaser shall be entitled to delay Completion solely because of a dispute
between the parties with regard to liability for such interest or compensation (if any) or as to the amount
of such interest or compensation payable PROVIDED ALWAYS that Completion and the delivery of any
Assurance on foot of these Conditions shall be had strictly without prejudice to the right of the Vendor to
pursue his claim for interest or the right of the Purchaser to pursue his claim for compensation.

15

in anticipation of completing the Sale shall not per se preclude the Vendor from exercising his rights under
the provisions of General Condition 21 and in the event of such exercise the said apportionment account or the
said other corresponding step shall (if appropriate) be deemed not to have been furnished or taken, and the
Vendor shall be entitled to furnish a further apportionment account.

require) the rents, profits, rates, outgoings and moneys until midnight on the Apportionment Date
unless the Purchaser shall opt prior to Completion to take the rents and profit less the outgoings referable
to the Apportionment Date and the Vendor shall receive the balance of the Purchase Price for value on the
Completion Date in which event the Purchaser shall be entitled to or liable for (as the case may require)
the rents, profits, rates, outgoings and moneys from and including the Apportionment Date.
(d)	The balance of the Purchase Price shall (where appropriate) be adjusted upwards or downwards to
accommodate apportionments calculated pursuant to this Condition and the expression “balance of the
Purchase Price” where used in the Conditions shall be construed accordingly.

ascertainable) amounts to be apportioned hereunder, including any amount apportionable pursuant to
this Condition, shall be apportioned provisionally on a fair estimate thereof, and, upon ascertainment of
the actual figures, a final apportionment shall be made, and the difference between it and the provisional

ten Working Days of the liable party becoming aware of the amount of such difference.

on the part of the Purchaser as are contained in the Conditions, unless and until he shall have disclosed to
the Vendor the name of his principal or other such party.

but such entitlement shall be without prejudice to any rights otherwise available to the Vendor.
28.	In case a cheque taken for the deposit (having been presented and whether or not it has been re-presented)
shall not have been honoured, then and on that account the Vendor may (without prejudice to any rights
otherwise available to him) elect either:

to have had notice under General Condition 14(a) nor in relation to any error in a location or similar plan

be prejudiced materially by reason of any such difference

		 or
		

(ii)	affect the right of the Purchaser to rescind or repudiate the Sale where compensation for a claim
attributable to a material error made by or on behalf of the Vendor cannot be reasonably assessed.

30. (a)	Documents of title relating to other property as well as to the Subject Property shall be retained by the
Vendor or other person entitled to the possession thereof.

thereon) be sufficient to discharge the aggregate of all amounts payable in satisfaction of such
mortgages and charges to the extent that they relate to the Subject Property

the said direction and the Purchaser shall not within twenty one days of the giving of such notice have
instituted and served proceedings disputing the rights alleged by the Vendor to forfeit the deposit.
DAMAGES FOR DEFAULT
38. (a)	Neither the Vendor nor the Purchaser, in whose favour an order for specific performance has been made,
shall be precluded from an award of damages at law or in equity, in the event of such order not being
complied with.
(b)	Notwithstanding any rule of law to the contrary, failure on the part of the Vendor to show title to the

	shall (unless otherwise agreed by the parties) in the first instance be referred to mediation. To initiate
the mediation a party shall give notice in writing (the “Mediation Notice”) to the other party requesting
mediation. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, the mediator will be nominated on the application
of either party by the President for the time being of the Law Society of Ireland or, should the said President
be absent, unwilling or unable to do so, by the next senior officer of that Society who is ready, willing and able
to make the nomination, whereupon the mediator will be appointed by the parties. The mediation will start
not later than twenty eight days after the date of appointment of the mediator. No party will commence court
proceedings or arbitration in relation to any difference or dispute referred to in this Condition unless he has
attempted to settle the dispute by mediation.
	If the mediation does not start within twenty eight days (or such longer period as the parties agree in writing)
from the date of appointment of the mediator or if the parties are unable to resolve the difference or dispute
by mediation within fifty six days from the date of appointment of the mediator the difference or dispute
shall be submitted to arbitration by a sole arbitrator to be appointed (in the absence of agreement between
the parties upon such appointment and on the application of either of them) by the President (or other officer
endowed with the functions of such President) for the time being of the Law Society of Ireland or (in the
event of the President or other officer as aforesaid being unable or unwilling to make the appointment) by the
next senior officer of that Society who is so able and willing to make the appointment and such arbitration
shall be governed by the Arbitration Act 2010 provided however that if the arbitrator shall relinquish his
appointment or die, or if it shall become apparent that for any reason he shall be unable or shall have become
unfit or unsuited (whether because of bias or otherwise) to complete his duties, or if he shall be removed from
office by court order, a substitute may be appointed in his place and in relation to any such appointment the
procedures hereinbefore set forth shall be deemed to apply as though the substitution were an appointment
de novo which said procedures may be repeated as many times as may be necessary.
