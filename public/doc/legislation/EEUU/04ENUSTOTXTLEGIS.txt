ยง1447. Referral fees; interference with brokerage relationships
A.(1) It is unlawful for any person, including but not limited to a relocation company, to directly
or indirectly solicit or request a referral fee or similar payment for the referral of a buyer or
seller unless the person seeking the referral fee has reasonable cause. Reasonable cause shall
not exist unless:
(a) The person seeking the referral fee introduced the client to the licensee or registrant from
whom the referral fee is being sought; or
(b) The person seeking the referral fee has a written contractual relationship with the licensee
or registrant for a referral fee or similar payment; and
(c) The licensee or registrant has received the client referral prior to the client contracting to
buy or list real estate with the licensee or registrant.
(2) The solicitation or request of a referral fee or similar payment in accordance with this
Subsection shall not create a legal right to be paid such fee or payment.
B. It is unlawful to interfere with a real estate brokerage relationship. The demand for a
referral fee from a licensee or registrant when reasonable cause for payment does not exist
constitutes interference with a real estate brokerage relationship. A threat by a third party to
reduce, withhold, or eliminate any relocation benefits in order to generate a referral fee from a
licensee or registrant when reasonable cause for payment does not exist also constitutes
interference with a real estate brokerage relationship. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
communications between an employer or its representative and an employee concerning
relocation policies and benefits shall not constitute interference with a real estate brokerage
relationship.
C. It is unlawful for any person, licensed or unlicensed, to interfere with the contractual
relationship between a licensee or registrant and a client by counseling a client or another
licensee or registrant on how to terminate or amend an existing contractual relationship
between a licensee or registrant and a client. Communicating a company's relocation policy or
benefits to an employee or consumer shall not be considered a violation of this Subsection as
long as the communication does not involve advice or encouragement on how to terminate or
amend an existing contractual relationship between a licensee or registrant and a client.
D. A prevailing party in any action for violations of this Section may be awarded actual
damages, plus reasonable attorney fees. In addition to bringing an action in court, violations of
this Section may be addressed through mediation services. Such mediation services shall
include but shall not be limited to mediation through real estate entities who specifically offer
programs for resolving complaints involving real estate referral fees.
Acts 2001, No. 261, ยง1.
ยง1448. Revocation or suspension of licenses
A. Any licensee whose license is suspended or revoked in accordance with this Chapter shall be
deemed an unlicensed person during the period of suspension or revocation and shall be
subject to the penalties prescribed for unlicensed persons, if he engages in activity requiring
licensure during the period of suspension or revocation. The commission retains jurisdiction
over all unlicensed persons relative to violations of and enforcement of the provisions of this
Chapter.
B. The revocation or suspension of a broker's license shall automatically suspend the license of
every associate broker or salesperson who is sponsored by the broker whose license was
suspended or revoked. The sponsoring broker shall, within seventy-two hours of notification by
the commission of the final action on the revocation or suspension of his license, return to the
commission all licenses of the licensees sponsored by him.
C. A sponsoring broker shall, within seventy-two hours of notification by the commission, return
his license or the license of any associate broker or salesperson sponsored by him when such

any action wherein the cause of action was based on any violation prescribed in this Chapter.
(b) At the time the action was commenced, the claimant gave notice thereof to the Real Estate

as required, the commission may intervene, enter an appearance, file an answer, defend the
action, or take any action it deems appropriate on behalf of, and in the name of, the defendant
and take recourse through any appropriate method of review on behalf of, and in the name of,
the defendant.
(c) The claimant has made such judgment executory, and the return of the constable or sheriff
showing that executing the same has made a return showing that no personal or real property
of the judgment debtor can be found, or that the amount realized on the sale of the judgment
debtor's property pursuant to such execution was insufficient to satisfy the judgment.
(d)(i) The claimant has made all reasonable searches and inquiries to ascertain whether the
judgment debtor is possessed of real or personal property or other assets subject to being sold
or applied in satisfaction of the judgment, and by his search he has discovered no property or
assets, or that he has discovered property and assets and that he has taken all necessary action
and proceedings for the application thereof to the judgment and that the amount thereby
realized was insufficient to satisfy the judgment.
(ii) The claimant has diligently pursued his remedies against all the judgment debtors and all
persons liable to him in the transaction for which he seeks recovery from the recovery fund. If
the recovery fund claim is based on the actions of a corporation, partnership, or limited liability
company, the claimant must have diligently pursued all possible remedies against the qualifying
broker for the corporation, partnership, or limited liability company.
(iii) If the judgment debtor has sought protection under the federal bankruptcy law, the
claimant must provide a stamped copy of the proof of claim submitted to the bankruptcy court
handling the case of the judgment debtor.
(e) Any amount recovered by the claimant from the judgment debtor, or from any other source,
has been applied to the damages awarded by the courts.

made within one hundred eighty days from the date of the final judgment of all judicial
proceedings, including appeals.
(g) After proper review, the commission may, after receiving written approval of the state
attorney general's office, pay the claim or offer such compromise as is deemed just and
equitable.
(2) Consent judgments shall not be eligible for payment from the recovery fund unless the
commission has intervened in the lawsuit and is a party to the consent judgment.
B.(1) The commission may, in lieu of meeting all the conditions for recovery set forth in
Paragraphs (1) through (5) of Subsection A, allow the aggrieved party to submit a claim to the
commission by notarized affidavit giving all the pertinent facts to the claim, when the claim is
based on the actions of one or more licensees who have been sanctioned by the commission in
an adjudicatory proceeding, the record of which corroborates the affidavit submitted by the
claimant, and the amount of the claim does not exceed two thousand dollars.
(2) The right to recover under the provisions of this Subsection shall be forever barred unless
application is made within one hundred eighty days from the effective date of the order issued
by the commission pursuant to an adjudicatory proceeding pertaining to a claim submitted by a
notarized affidavit, including appeals.
(3) Claims submitted by notarized affidavit may be paid by the commission after receiving

commission, to the extent of the commission's right, title and interest therein, shall be for the
purpose of reimbursing the recovery fund.

upon a voucher signed by the chairman of the commission, or his designee.
