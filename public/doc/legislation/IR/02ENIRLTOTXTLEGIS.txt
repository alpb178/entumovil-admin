We apply to be registered as owners of the property (subject to the charges

have priority to the trusts on which we hold the property and we assent to the
registration of such burdens and to the entry of an inhibition to protect such

Signed:
(To be signed by the applicants and their signatures attested. If not attested by a
solicitor, an affidavit by the attesting witness may be required.)
Note (1) — Where the Trustees hold on trust for sale the appropriate inhibition to
be applied for is a restriction against all dealings by the registered owners or the
survivors or survivor of them except by way of sale. Where the property is not held
on trust for sale, the utmost care should be taken in framing the inhibition to ensure
that while no entry should be made which would interfere with the exercise by the
trustees of any authorised powers, e.g., powers of sale and charging the interests of
the beneficiaries are adequately protected by the terms of the inhibition. It is not the
duty of the Authority to advise on the suitability or otherwise of any particular form
of inhibition nor should the terms of an inhibition be phrased in such a manner as
would involve it in an enquiry into the manner in which the trusts are being administered. Normally, the interests of the beneficiaries would be adequately protected by
the entry of an inhibition requiring the consent of, or notice to, the beneficiaries or,
(in the case of persons of unsound mind) their committees.
Note (2) — If there are more than two trustees, the form should be amended
accordingly.
